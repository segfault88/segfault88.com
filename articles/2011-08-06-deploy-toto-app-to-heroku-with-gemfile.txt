title: Deploy Toto App to Heroku with Gemfile

Well, this is totally obvious - but unfortunately it wasn't for me. I have been messing around with creating a [Toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto) based blog for a little while. However today I needed to use a custom version of a gem (namely my fork of Toto itself), while the solution to use Bundler is totally obvious, getting it actually working was not soo obvious for me.

So create your Gemfile, bundle and push to Heroku. Now if you are like me your application will immediately crash and you will have something like this in your log:
<pre>

2011-08-05T04:18:34+00:00 app[web.1]: from /home/heroku_rack/heroku.ru:23:in `eval'
</pre>

What is the problem? Well, I spent a while looking around through Heroku's docs and couldn't see anything helpful even on their [Gem bundler page](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/bundler). Had I actually gone to the [Bundler website](http://gembundler.com/) itself I would have seen the (very easy) solution.

Simply add this to the top of your config.ru file before any existing require calls:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1126943.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>

Thats it! Pretty easy.
