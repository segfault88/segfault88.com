title: Sass CarbonCore FS Events

Just a quick note for future reference. While running Sass on OSX with the "watch" flag and you get the message:

<pre>
Warning: Unable to load CarbonCore. FSEvents will be unavailable.
</pre>

This probably caused by running a custom version of Ruby - for example with RVM which doesn't install the Carbon MacRuby library. This isn't a show stopper since it will fall back to polling for changes - which doesn't work all that well. Although it is possible to install MacRuby for a custom install of Ruby a simpler solution exists.

* First install the rb-rsevents gem. This gives the same functionality without requiring the MacRuby stuff.
* Install a newer version of the fssm gem which Sass uses to watch for file changes. A newer version includes support for watching for file changes using rb-rsevents. I am using 0.2.7 - and that seems to work fine.

Simply:
<pre>
gem install rb-fsevents
gem install fssm
</pre>

Should do the trick. Good luck!
