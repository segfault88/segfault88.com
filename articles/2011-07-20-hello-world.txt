Hello, world!

This is my attempt to do some stuff and get more involved with the community. I have created this
site in the hopes of (eventually) doing something useful. I have made a new Github and Twitter
account too - so if you want, feel free to leave a comment or ping me on Twitter or Github.

Anyway, have fun :).
